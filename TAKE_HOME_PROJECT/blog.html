            <p>
                Web accessibility is crucial for ensuring that people with disabilities can use and interact with websites effectively. It includes designing and developing websites in a way that accommodates individuals with varying abilities and disabilities.

Therefore, creating accessible websites not only helps a significant portion of the population but also ensures legal compliance and a broader user base.
